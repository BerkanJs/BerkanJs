ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Berkan

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, especially in the JavaScript ecosystem (React, Next.js, Node.js) and backend technologies like Spring Boot. I also have a strong background in data analysis and data science, with hands-on experience in Python for machine learning and statistical modeling.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spring Boot and diving deeper into backend development. My next goals are to master cloud technologies, Docker, and Kubernetes.

ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on full-stack web projects, data-driven applications, and open-source contributions.
